The goal of this program challenge is to predict the probability of customers churn on one of BCG clients called PowerCo.
PowerCo is a company that focus on supplying gas and electricity for SME( Small Medium Enterprises) and residential customers.
They want to derive an effective decision to the declining customers lately by collaboration with BCG.
One hypothesis that likely to happen of the customers churn during period of January to March 2016 is the price sensitiviy and the issue of power-liberalization market in Europe.
We, as consultant want to understand the data better and derive actionable insights through the hypothesis whether we should consider marketing strategy that PowerCo is trying to do by offering 20% discount to the customers churn.
Is it an effective way to do or any other solutions that we can deliver to the client.
As this is a classification problem, we will be using one or more classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision tree and Random Forest by always checking a few importants parts such as overfitting or underfitting model.
We will analyze three datasets that we will believe can support the insights by following data :

1.Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
2.Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
3.Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not
